## How to Run the Agent

You can interact with the agent through the XpressAI platform. For example, send a task using CLI:
```
http POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/chat/completions model=default messages[0][role]=user messages[0][content]="<YOUR TASK DESCRIPTION>"
```

Alternatively, use the Python script to send multiple tasks:
```
python send_prompts_to_agent.py

```

---

## Tasks and Outputs:
The agent processes tasks line by line or based on structured JSON inputs. It generates output files and logs results in a agent_results.json file.

---
### Additional Resources

The agent comes with the following predefined resources to facilitate tasks:

- **financial_docs**: A folder containing financial documents that the agent can read to generate detailed financial reports and create corresponding charts. This directory serves as the primary source for financial analysis tasks.

- **tasks.json**: A file containing examples of tasks the agent can perform. This includes sample prompts for tasks such as translating text, answering questions, converting images, and generating reports. Use this file as a reference to understand the agent's capabilities and structure new tasks.

---

### Available Tools

The agent is equipped with the following six tools to perform various tasks efficiently:

1. **read_documents_and_generate_report**: Reads financial documents from a specified folder and generates a financial report based on the data.

2. **translate_text**: Translates text from a file into a target language.

3. **convert_images**: Converts images from one format (e.g., JPEG) to another (e.g., PNG) and saves them in the specified directory.

4. **save_text_file**: Writes generated outputs such as reports or translations to a specific file and directory.

5. **generate_financial_charts**: Create financial charts based on the data provided in the report generated by the agent.

6. **send_message_to_slack**: Sends summaries, updates, or results to a configured Slack channel for user notifications.


## Evaluation

The evaluation process uses **GPT-4o** to verify task outputs. Running `evaluation.py` performs the following checks:

- **Image Conversion**: Ensures images were converted correctly.
- **Chart Generation**: Confirms charts were created in the expected directory.
- **Translation Quality**: Rates translations on a scale of 1 to 10 with feedback.
- **Report Evaluation**: Compares financial reports with source data and assigns a rating from 1 to 10.

Evaluation relies on `tasks.py` for input/output mapping.
